# Dark Room
We are going to create an interactive game named “Dark Room.” The objective of this game is to find objects by moving and looking around a dark room where the character has the flash light to illuminate the area that the character is looking at.

## Game rule details:
The player will be given a list of objects to find at the beginning of the game. As texts outside of the graphics in the web page (in HTML) After the game begins, the player will move around a dark room with a flashlight to find all the objects given in the beginning.

When the player sees one of the objects, the player will point at the object and click on the mouse so that the system can detect that the player’s camera was pointing at the object. Each object that is found by the player is marked off. The game ends when the player finds all the objects.
